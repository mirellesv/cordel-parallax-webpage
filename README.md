# 📜 Cordel Moderno — HTML & CSS (Parallax)

This was one of the first front-end projects I built while learning **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

It is a simple website that turns the poem **"Cordel Moderno"** (by Milton Duarte) into a responsive page and applies a **parallax-style effect** using fixed background images.
